### HIGH PRIORTY:
- organize folders into `bin` and `src`
- improve logging output
  - pass i.e. `--log-quiet` option only to `conda` and `pip` (not `poetry`)
  - disable colors when logging
### LOW PRIORITY:
- pickup progress bar from `install_cross_compilers`
- add `Python` and `pip` if not in `conda` environment
