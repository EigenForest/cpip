### HIGH PRIORTY:
- refactor arg / opt error message to be cleaner
- switch `--unlock` option to use `poetry update`
- make new command `create` which skips packing
- new option `--post-install` for `pack`;
  allows scripts to execute WITHIN build env
- organize folders into `bin` and `src`
### LOW PRIORITY:
- check `--no-color` for multiple appearances
- pickup progress bar from `install_cross_compilers`
