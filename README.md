# cpip

## What is it?
This tool creates a `conda` environment, with `pip` dependencies,
in any desired location, or packages it into a portable tarball. 

## How does it work?
1. Assembles an environment with basic `conda` commands from
given `conda` environment files
1. Installs cross-compilers and downloads/compiles `pip` packages
1. Packages `conda` environment via `conda-pack` tool
1. Unpacks environment to desired location (optional with `create` command)

## Supported Operating Systems
- Linux
- macOS

## System Requirements
- [conda](https://conda.io/docs/)
- [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/) (optional)

## Environment Dependencies
- [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) (installed via `conda`)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (installed via `conda`)

## Usage

#### 1) Create Build Environment
`conda env create -f cpip`

#### 2) Activate Build Environment
`conda activate cpip`

#### 3) Run 'cpip pack' or 'cpip create'
For more information: `cpip pack --help` or `cpip create --help`

#### 4) Unpack and Activate
    Initial Setup (if using 'cpip pack'):
      1. untar archive        --> tar -xf <archive>
      2. activate environment --> source <root-dir>/bin/activate
      3. fix path prefixes    --> conda unpack
    
    Normal Use:
      *  activate             --> source <root-dir>/bin/activate
      *  deactivate           --> source deactivate

    Info:
      *  conda dependencies     @ <archive-root>/dependencies/<archive-name>.yml
      *  poetry lockfile        @ <archive-root>/dependencies/poetry.lock

## Cleaning Caches
Use `cpip clean` command to clean the conda and/or pip caches

## Other Things to Note

#### Conda Configuration
The only change made to the configuration is that `defaults`
is removed from the `channels` key in order to enforce better
consistency. Changing other settings may yield unexpected results.

#### Poetry Configuration
`cpip pack` internally sets `settings.virtualenvs.create` to `false`,
but restores the setting to its original value upon failure.

#### Installing pip dependencies with Conda vs. Poetry
`pip` dependencies can be installed via `conda` or `poetry`.
It is recommended to use a `poetry` project to define all the `pip`
packages in your project; this allows for lockfiles to pin package
versions properly. If you decide to use `poetry`, it makes sense to
move ALL `pip` dependencies from the `conda` environment `.yml` files
to a `poetry` project `.toml` file.

#### Cross-Compilers
Cross-compilers will be installed for if any `pip` dependencies are
detected. After installing all the `pip` dependencies, the compilers
will be removed but the associated libraries will remain for the
final package.

#### Order of Environments
This tool can take more than one `conda` environment file.
These files will be loaded in the order they are given on
the command line. Different command line orders may produce
slightly different environments.

#### Concurrency
Multiple `cpip` processes can be run concurrently if we do the following:
- if not using a `poetry` lockfile, use seperate `poetry` project directories
- create a build environment for each process, i.e. for process `X`
  1. `conda env create -n cpip-X -f cpip.yml`
  1. `conda env activate cpip-X`

##### TODO: Non-Unix Systems
For systems that don't respect the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable,
Poetry may have concurrency issues, however, if using a `poetry.lock` file,
this will relieve any potential cache conflicts.

The cache issues can be solved completely if `poetry` allows for the
something more flexible like a `--poetry-cache-dir` command line option.
